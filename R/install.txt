Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Check if you have permissions for your R libraries directory. If
   not, set up a local R library directory, e.g.:
     mkdir ~/R_Libraries
     export R_LIBS=~/R_Libraries

2. Install the developer packages for R, boost and gsl. They are
   required to compile Larpack and other R packages.

   Depending on your Linux distibution, these packages may be named as
   follows:
    - R-devel, boost-devel, gsl-devel (Fedora)
    - R-base-dev, libboost-dev, libgsl0-dev (Ubuntu)

3. Compile and install Larpack R package: 
     cd {Larpack-Root}/R
     R CMD INSTALL Larpack

   Note: If you already compiled the command-line version, existing
   object-files may be linked and lead to odd errors. Make sure you
   invoke "make clean" in the source/ directory in this case.

4. In R run
     library(affy)
     mydata <- ReadAffy() # one or more celfiles should be present in current working directory
     library(larpack)
     # the so-called probe sequence file for your chip-type must be given as second parameter
     # it can be downloaded at http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/downloads/data/
     results = runLarpack(mydata, "~/LibraryFiles/Mouse430_2_probe_tab", list("sequence-profile-rank"="2", "use-gstacks-correction"=""))
     plot(results$CorrectedHookcurveSumLogI[,1], results$CorrectedHookcurveDeltaLogI[,1])  
     ...
