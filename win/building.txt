Building instructions for Larpack for Visual Studio
---------------------------------------------------

A) Installing the tools

* Install Visual C++ 2005 Express (or Studio) 
  (free Express Version can be obtained from http://www.microsoft.com/express/2005/download/default.aspx)
* Install Platform SDK into directory (VCInstall)\PlatformSDK
* Install Boost libary binaries from http://www.boost-consulting.com/products/free
  selecting all prebuilded libs (multi-threaded debug,...) for VC 8
* Install GSL binaries from Gnuwin32 http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm
  untested alternative: * Install GSL source (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) 
* Build GSL with VC++ project file included in [gsl]/src/VC8 in Release Mode and copy the resulting 
  files libgsl_dll.lib and libgslcblas_dll.lib into [Larpack]\win directory (any other directory VC 8
  looks for the libraries)

B) Configuring VC++

* Configure the directories in Tools -> Options ->Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories. Add:
  - BOOST directory to Include Files
  - BOOST\lib directory to Library Files
  - GSL include to Include Files
  - GSL library to Library Files
  - (If you installed Platform SDK to another directory, you'll have to add it's include and lib as well)
* Build included Larpack VC++ solution
